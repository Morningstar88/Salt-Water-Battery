#### Yashas V Rao
 · 
- When two dissimilar metals or metallic compounds are immersed in an electrolyte, there will be a potential difference produced between these metals or metallic compounds. 

#### Electrolyte

It is found that, when some specific compounds are added to water, they get dissolved and produce negative and positive ions. This type of compound is called an electrolyte. 

The popular examples of electrolytes are almost all kinds of salts, acids, and bases etc. 

The energy released during accepting an electron by a neutral atom is known as electron affinity. 

As the atomic structure for different materials are different, the electron affinity of different materials will differ. If two different kinds of metals or metallic compounds are immersed in the same electrolyte solution, one of them will gain electrons and the other will release electrons. 

Which metal or metallic compound will gain electrons and which will lose them depends upon the electron affinities of these metals or metallic compounds. 

The metal with low electron affinity will gain electrons from the negative ions of the electrolyte solution.

On the other hand, the metal with high electron affinity will release electrons and these electrons come out into the electrolyte solution and are added to the positive ions of the solution. In this way, one of these metals or compounds gains electrons and another one loses electrons. 

As a result, there will be a difference in electron concentration between these two metals. 

- This difference of electron concentration causes an electrical potential difference to develop between the metals. 

- This electrical potential difference or emf can be utilized as a source of voltage in any electronics or electrical circuit. 

This is a general and basic principle of battery.

# [How Do Batteries Work, TedEd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OVtk6G2TnQ)

- Battery technology started in 1780s with Galvani and Alessandro Volta. 

** Volta's first experient:** 

Alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper cloth in a salt water solution. 

** Oxidation and Reduction**

- Zinc oxidizes, loses electrons, which are gained by the ions in the water. 

- This process is called reduction, and produces hydrogen gas. 

- Oxidation-Reduction cycle creates a flow of electrons between two substances.  
 
- Hook a vaccuum or light bulb up between the two, you'll give it power. 

- A metal oxidizes, sending electrons to do some work, before they are regained by a substance being reduced.

- A battery has a finite supply of metal. Once most of it has oxidised, the battery dies.

Oxidation: Losing electrons.

# Cathodes, Anodes, Electrolytes                                                                                  
                                                                                     
Graphite( Carbon Material) can ben used as used as Anode. 
The reason behind the use of Graphite can be explained due to its internal structure.

### The anode is always where oxidation happens 
### The cathode is always where reduction happens. (Vowel goes with vowel and consonant goes with consonant).

What is reduction and oxidation in chemistry?

There are technically a number of different ways by which you can define these processes, I will be explaining most of them.

### Oxidation can be defined as:-

- Addition of Oxygen or an electronegative element.
- Losing of electrons
Removal of Hydrogen or an electropositive element.
Increase in the oxidation number
If any one of these conditions are satisfied, the process is an oxidation process.

### Reduction can be defined as:-

Addition of hydrogen or an electropositive element.
Removal of Oxygen or an electronegative element.
Gaining of electrons.
Decrease in oxidation number.
Normally, we use the definitions which are in bold because both of them technically refer to the above two statements.

- Cells are comprised of 3 essential components.

### OILRIG is an acronym to help remember, Oxidation Is Losing electrons, Reduction Is Gaining electrons.

ANODE - REDUCING - RELEASE ELECTRONS

CATHODE - OXIDIZES - REDUCED/REDUCTIOL - AQUIRES ELECTRONS

- The Anode is the negative or reducing electrode that releases electrons to the external circuit and oxidizes during an electrochemical reaction.

- The Cathode is the positive or oxidizing electrode that acquires electrons from the external circuit and is reduced during the electrochemical reaction.

The Electrolyte is the medium that provides the ion transport mechanism between the cathode and anode of a cell. Electrolytes are often thought of as liquids, such as water or other solvents, with dissolved salts, acids, or alkalis that are required for ionic conduction. It should however be noted that many batteries including the conventional (AA/AAA/D) batteries contain solid electrolytes that act as ionic conductors at room temperature

The species which donates electrons is reductant.

The one which accepts electrons oxidant.

### Oxidation: removal of electrons

### Reduction: addition of electrons

The one which is undergoing oxidation is called reductant.

The one which is undergoing reduction is called oxidant.

## Voltaic Cells

#### Some metals lose electrons more readily than other metals.

- Current flows out of the cathode. A useful mnemonic for remembering this is CCD: Cathode Current Departs.
- Copper is an anode. An element that gains electrons are used as anode, and those lose electrons used as cathode
- This can be exploited to produce a flow of electrons from one piece of metal to another.
- Submerge two pieces of different metals in a conductive solution, such as a solution of metal salts. 
- Zinc and copper can be used to make a voltaic cell because zinc gives up electrons more readily than copper. The metal plates are called the electrodes: the anode and the cathode.

##  Lemon Battery

A battery can be made using a piece of fruit or a vegetable such as a lemon or a potato to provide the electrolyte. 
The juice inside is conductive so when two pieces of metal, such as a copper penny and a zinc nail, are pushed into the fruit, an electric current is produced. This can be used to power a small electronic device with a low power requirement, such as a digital display.

## What is the best metal to use for electrolysis of water?

** You can use pretty much any metal for the cathode (the electrode that evolves hydrogen), but the anode is more difficult.** 

You need something that will resist corrosion while remaining electrically conductive. The reason this is difficult is because the anode is generating oxygen, and so the anode environment is strongly oxidizing and fiercely corrosive.

If cost is no object, you can use platinum (or probably gold, or other noble metals). These work because the metals are more stable than their oxides, and so they simply won’t corrode under normal conditions.

Lead will work, particularly if you add sodium sulfate salt to the water to make the water more conductive. The lead will form a layer of PbO2, which is one of the few metal oxides that are conductive. Sulfate in the water will keep the lead oxide from dissolving too quickly. But, it does corrode somewhat, and then you have lead in your water.

A compromise is what are referred to as “Dimensionally Stable Anodes”. These are a titanium base, coated with a very thin layer of “mixed metal oxides”, which are proprietary mixtures but I believe they are mostly RuO2 and/or IrO2. These are also electrically-conductive oxides, but unlike PbO2, they are pretty much insoluble in most solutions. I use these in my laboratory, and they last for years. They are fairly pricey (a 1/2 inch diameter rod 4 feet long cost me $140), but if you want a long-lasting, trouble-free anode, they are worth it.
